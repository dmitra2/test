              game's earliest known mention can be traced back to the Ming
              dynasty, documented in the book "Wuzazu" authored by Xie Zhaozhe,
              a prominent writer of the era, whose activity centered around the
              1600s. Within "Wuzazu," Xie Zhaozhe attributes the game to the Han
              dynasty, a period extending from 206 BCE to 220 CE, suggesting a
              venerable lineage for the game.
            </p>
            <p>
              Xie Zhaozhe identifies the game by the name "shoushiling" in
              "Wuzazu," providing an initial insight into its historical
              appellation. Moreover, Li Rihua's "Note of Liuyanzhai" further
              elucidates the game's nomenclature, introducing alternative names
              such as "huozhitou" and "huaquan" alongside "shoushiling." This
              additional detail offers a richer understanding of the linguistic
              diversity surrounding the game across different historical
              sources.

            <p>
              These literary references not only shed light on the game's
              antiquity but also hint at its cultural significance during
              various periods in Chinese history. By delving into the
              terminology used to describe the game, scholars can glean insights
              into its evolution and adaptation across different regions and
              eras within China.

              game, originally from China, found its way to Japan where it
              became known as sansukumi-ken, or "fist games of the three who are
              afraid of one another." The earliest version in Japan was
              mushi-ken, believed to have been directly imported from China. In
              mushi-ken, gestures representing a frog, a slug, and a snake
              determine the outcome, with the frog triumphing over the slug, the
              slug over the snake, and the snake over the frog. Although the
              Chinese and Japanese versions initially differed in the animals
              represented due to a character confusion, mushi-ken laid the
              groundwork for later variations.
            </p>
            <p>
              The most popular iteration in Japan, kitsune-ken, featured a fox
              defeating the village head, the village head defeating the hunter,
              and the hunter defeating the fox. Kitsune-ken distinguished itself
              from other versions by requiring gestures with both hands.
            </p>
            <p>
              Today, the widely recognized version of sansukumi-ken is jan-ken,
              a variation introduced from China in the 17th century. Jan-ken
              utilizes the rock, paper, and scissors signs, which directly
              influenced the modern rendition of rock paper scissors. Hand-games
              representing these conflicting elements have been prevalent since
              the late 19th century, bridging the Edo and Meiji periods.

              the early 20th century, the game of rock paper scissors
              transcended its origins in East Asia, proliferating globally,
              especially due to increased Japanese interactions with the Western
              world. Its English name derives from a translation of the Japanese
              hand gestures for rock, paper, and scissors. However, in other
              parts of East Asia, such as China, the open-palm gesture signifies
              "cloth" instead of "paper." Notably, the distinct shape of the
              scissors used in the game is also influenced by the Japanese
              style.
            </p>
            <p>
              In various publications around the world during the early 20th
              century, rock paper scissors was depicted under different names
              and contexts. For instance, a 1921 article in the Sydney Morning
              Herald referred to it as "stone, scissors, and paper," labeling it
              as a "Teutonic method of drawing lots" encountered while traveling
              in Europe. Another article from the same year in the Washington
              Herald described it as a form of "Chinese gambling." Similarly, in
              Britain in 1924, it was described in a letter to The Times as a
              hand game possibly of Mediterranean origin called "zhot," later
              identified as the Japanese game Jan-ken-pon. These references
              highlight the game's growing international recognition and its
              various cultural interpretations.
            </p>
            <p>
              Rock paper scissors also found its way into literature, further
              indicating its familiarity in different parts of the world. For
              instance, in Hildegard G. Frey's novels in the Campfire Girls
              series from the early 20th century, the game is mentioned without
              explanation, suggesting its widespread understanding among
              American readers. Furthermore, in 1927, a children's magazine in
              France, La Vie au patronage, provided a detailed description of
              the game, referring to it as a "jeu japonais" ("Japanese game").
              Its French name, "Chi-fou-mi," is rooted in Old Japanese words for
              "one, two, three" ("hi, fu, mi"). These instances underscore the
              global diffusion of rock paper scissors and its incorporation into
              mainstream culture across continents.
